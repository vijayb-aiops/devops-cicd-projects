# Project 07: CI/CD Integration

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Automated deployment pipeline with multiple tool integrations

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- GitHub Actions\n- Docker\n- Kubernetes\n- AWS ECS

## 📊 Situation
Manual deployments were taking 2+ hours with high error rates

## 🎯 Task
Build automated CI/CD pipeline that reduces deployment time and increases reliability

## ⚡ Action
1. Set up GitHub Actions workflow\n2. Configure Docker containerization\n3. Deploy to Kubernetes\n4. Implement health checks\n5. Add monitoring

## 🏆 Results
- Deployment time reduced from 2 hours to 5 minutes\n- 90% reduction in deployment errors\n- Automated testing integrated\n- Rollback capabilities added
